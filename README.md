# SharpMath
A set of utility classes regarding math in C#. 

---------------------------------------
## What does this do?
This library is intended to provide various mathematical structures and functions for general use. 

---------------------------------------
## Features
* A Point3 struct, for when you need to work with three dimensions. 
* A PointD struct, for when you need that little bit more accuracy than the PointF struct offers. 
* A vector2D class, allowing many common vector operations to be used on it in a straight-forward way. 
* A vectorAngled2D class, which is a special variant of the Vector2D class. It allows defining and manipulating a vector based on an angle. 
* A Polygon2D class, allowing you to create and manipulate polygons in two dimensional space.
